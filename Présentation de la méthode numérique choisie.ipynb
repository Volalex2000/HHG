    "\n",
    "- This numerical method allows flexibility on the spatial and temporal regions studied. We can choose to focus on the regions where the phenomenon occurs (depending on the potential and the laser field).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Boundary conditions (here Dirichlet with the wave function vanishing at the edges) are naturally integrated into the discretization of the PDE.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Advantages of the Crank-Nicolson Scheme\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Unconditional Stability\n",
    "\n",
    "The Crank-Nicolson scheme has the advantage of being unconditionally stable, which means it remains stable regardless of the time step $\\Delta_t$. In the explicit scheme, the imaginary term $i$ implies that the solution would be unstable regardless of the chosen time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Accuracy (second-order in time and space)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Crank-Nicolson scheme is second-order in time and space, which means that the solution error decreases proportionally to $O(\\Delta_t^2 + \\Delta_x^2)$. Therefore, we can obtain relatively accurate results without very small time and space steps that would require significant computation time.\n",
